The goal of the *Docker Flow Monitor* project is to provide an easy way to reconfigure Prometheus every time a new service is deployed, or when a service is updated. It does not try to "reinvent the wheel", but to leverage the existing leaders and combine them through an easy to use integration. It uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) as a metrics storage and query engine and adds custom logic that allows on-demand reconfiguration.

Please visit the [tutorial](/tutorial) for a brief introduction or [Configuring Docker Flow Monitor](/config) and [Usage](/usage) sections for more details.
